                    <h3>CPU</h3>
                    <p class="hidden"><strong class="pc-component-text">CPU (Central Processing Unit)</strong>: The CPU
                        is the "brain" of the computer that performs all the calculations and manages all
                        the other components. It determines how fast your computer can process data and run
                        applications, making it a critical
                        component for gaming performance.</p>

                        main circuit board that connects all the other components together, such as the CPU,
                        memory, and video card. It determines what kind of CPU and memory you can use and how many
                        components you can install.
                        It also contains features such as USB and audio ports and provides power to all the other
                        components.
